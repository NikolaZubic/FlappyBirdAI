# FlappyBirdAI

## About project
Implementation of Flappy Bird reinforcement learning agent by using two approaches:
  * Q learning
  * Monte Carlo Q learning

## Programs & libraries needed in order to run this project 
* [PLE: A Reinforcement Learning Environment](https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) mimicking the Arcade Learning Environment interface, allowing a quick start to Reinforcement Learning in Python
* [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) Python Imaging Library
* [pyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games
* [monte-carlo-tree-search](https://github.com/ImparaAI/monte-carlo-tree-search) Python3 library for running a Monte Carlo tree search, which was modified and used to merge with Q learning logic to create Monte Carlo Q Learning approach
* other helper modules which can be installed manually
